        <p class="card-text">
          <p>We grouped based on the needs of applicants (grantees) and funders (grantors). During the card sort, we eliminated cards related to "System-to-System" based on feedback from our usability tests. Additionally, due to the sheer amount of cards we "defined," we were able to make categories using those instead of creating new ones.</p>
          <p>Every single step of the grants lifecycle is a complex endeavor, as many often require multiple entities to get involved. For example, a public health grant might involve multiple clinics, a university researcher, and the state's Department of Public Health.</p>

    <img class="card-img-top wireframe" src="./images/navigationprototype.gif" alt="Card image cap">
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">After creating the sitemap, we made even more iterations to simplify the navigation process by taking out some secondary menu items.</p>
        <p>The major takeaway of our usability testing was the broadening our primary users: applicants in varying stages of the grant application process (prospective, in-progress, submitted, and awarded) and grantors with the funding and requirements for monitoring and evaluation.</p>

<section class="style"><h2>Style Guide</h2>
<p class="bodyText">Grants.Gov is a grantmaker's hub for discovering funding opportunities that can lead to global innovation and systemic change. The website promotes diversity, inclusion, and partnership-building with its minimal and colorful aesthetic. Grants.Gov uses illustrations that highlight entrepreneurialism and process.
<br><br>When people and organizations bring their ideas come together, they can solve the world's problems. Grantmaking might be a daunting process with no guarantees, but navigating Grants.Gov shouldn't be.</p>
<h3>Brand Identity and Guide</h3>
<div class="card" style="width: 30rem;">
    <img class="card-img-top styleGuide" src="./images/styleguideColor.png" alt="Card image cap">
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text"><p>Grants.Gov primarily consists of various shades of purple and plenty of white space. The dark purple is the most dominant, used for body text and navigation. The blueberry and grayish purples serve as the color for sub-headers for the secondary pages and smaller Calls to Action.</p>
        <p>Unlike most government websites, there are few stock photos that can depict grantmaking in an engaging way outside of a person typing on the computer or writing on paper. Colorful illustrations (inspired by websites for startups and project management services) were the solution to this problem. The sprinkles of pink, orange, lime green, and sunflower yellow became the main palette for these illustrations and created a friendly and welcoming atmosphere for site visitors.</p></p>
    </div>
</div>
<h3>Logo</h3>
<div class="card" style="width: 30rem;">
    <img class="card-img-top styleGuide" src="./images/grantsgovlogo.png" alt="Card image cap">
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">We updated the logo to better suit the new style guide and aesthetics. As with the rest of the website, we used illustrations for the logo to show the limitless goldmine of opportunities of grantmaking. The cogwheels function similarly to thought bubbles, signifying that grants play a part in a project's overall success. </p>
    </div>
</div>
<h3>Typography and Iconography</h3>
<div class="card" style="width: 30rem;">
    <img class="card-img-top styleGuide" src="./images/styleguideFont.png" alt="Card image cap">
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">Grants.Gov's font is Avenir, a san serif typeface. Avenir is the French word for "future," which aligns with Grants.Gov's position in the sphere of government websites as a hub for experimentation, innovative thinking, infrastructure building, and systemic change.
      <p>Avenir's simplicity allows users to focus solely on the important information and avoid distractions by using only one font with various weights, which is crucial for grantmakers who need to closely follow application instructions for a successful grant proposal submission.</p></p>
    </div>
</div>
<h3>Photography/Images</h3>
<div class="card" style="width: 30rem;">
    <img class="card-img-top styleGuide" src="./images/styleguideImages.png" alt="Card image cap">
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">
       
        <p>Iconography plays a factor in the way Grants.Gov users interact with the website. The majority of the icons are shades of purple that blend into with the rest of the website aesthetic. The exceptions to this design choice are the Search and Check icons. In addition to purple, Search can also be pink to emphasize the Call to Action for grantmakers to seek funding opportunities. The Check icon is green to indicate "positive" feedback (i.e. submit, completion, etc.).</p></p>

<h2>Reflection and Next Steps</h2>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p class="bodyText">In addition to the UI skills we improved on in this unit, our team's skill sets complemented each other very well. One of us comes from a graphic design background while the other has experience with grants research and writing, providing us a massive advantage for this case study.<br><br>
While we were concerned that class moved remotely about a week into this case study, we quickly embraced the transition thanks to the convenience of video conferencing apps like Google Hangouts and Zoom as well as digital collaboration tools such as Miro, Invision, and Adobe XD. These tools really pushed us to be in constant communication with each other.</p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Desktop and Mobile</b> / Build more pages. We would like to create the rest of the pages in the "Grants 101" sub-navigation of "About Grants" and demonstrate how the "Search Grants" function would look like. Additionally, experiment with more micro-interactions, especially ones that users often experience on other websites.</li>
    <li><b>Desktop-Specific</b> / Experiment with more button states besides "Normal" and "Hover," such as "Pressed" and "Disabled."</li>
    <li><b>Mobile-Specific</b> / Experiment with different gestures besides scrolling up and down.</li>
</ul>
