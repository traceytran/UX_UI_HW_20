          Tina, a development coordinator at a food scarcity nonprofit organization, struggles to find the right funding opportunities on Grants.Gov due to challenges in finding information and difficulties in completing tasks on the current website.

        <h5 class="card-title">Redline Analysis</h5>
        <p class="card-text">
          <p>We grouped based on the needs of applicants (grantees) and funders (grantors). During the card sort, we eliminated cards related to "System-to-System" based on feedback from our usability tests. Additionally, due to the sheer amount of cards we "defined," we were able to make categories using those instead of creating new ones.</p>
          <p>Every single step of the grants lifecycle is a complex endeavor, as many often require multiple entities to get involved. For example, a public health grant might involve multiple clinics, a university researcher, and the state's Department of Public Health.</p>

<h2>Wireframing and Prototyping</h2>
<h3>Low Fidelity</h3>

    <img class="card-img-top" src="./images/navigationprototype.gif" alt="Card image cap">
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">We built out the Grants.Gov home page in conjunction with the navigation iteration, which comprise of 3 major sections: Search Grants, What Are Grants?, and Grant Eligibility. Some feedback we received on this prototype: "More" links for the homepage were inconspicuous, spacing is inconsistent in the submenu which makes it confusing to navigate, and the social media icons were small.</p>
    </div>

<div class="card" style="width: 30rem;">
  <img class="card-img-top" src="./images/lofiprototype.gif" alt="Card image cap">
  <p class="card-text"><p>We iterated on our wireframes by changing font sizes, spell checking, and adding colors.</p>

<h2>Style Guide</h2>
<p>Purple ended up being our main color due to its association with creativity and wisdom. Applicants using Grants.Gov's services are often well-regarded thought leaders in their respective industries and sectors, coming from prestigious institutions and universities. Additionally, we wanted to bring out the creative aspect of grant-writing, as applicants use their words to develop compelling proposals. Coupled with vibrant pinks, greens, purples, and yellows, we wanted to give Grants.Gov a start-up aesthetic. As a grant-writer myself, organizations of varying sizes embody the entrepreneurial spirit through mission-driven organizations.</p>
<h3>Brand Identity and Guide</h3>
<div class="card" style="width: 75rem;">
    <img class="card-img-top" src="./images/styleguide.png" alt="Card image cap">
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text"><p>Grants.Gov primarily consists of various shades of purple and plenty of white space. The dark purple is the most dominant, used for body text and navigation. The blueberry and grayish purples serve as the color for sub-headers for the secondary pages and smaller Calls to Action.</p>
        <p>Unlike most government websites, there are few stock photos that can depict grantmaking in an engaging way outside of a person typing on the computer or writing on paper. Colorful illustrations (inspired by websites for startups and project management services) were the solution to this problem. The sprinkles of pink, orange, lime green, and sunflower yellow became the main palette for these illustrations and created a friendly and welcoming atmosphere for site visitors.</p></p>

<h3>Logo</h3>
<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
    <img class="card-img-top" src="./images/grantsgovlogo.png" alt="Card image cap">
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">We updated the logo to better suit the new style guide and aesthetics. As with the rest of the website, we used illustrations for the logo to show the limitless goldmine of opportunities of grantmaking. The cogwheels function similarly to thought bubbles, signifying that grants play a part in a project’s overall success. </p>

<h3>Typography and Iconography</h3>

<h3>Photography/Images</h3>
<div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
    <img class="card-img-top" src="..." alt="Card image cap">
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text"><p>Grants.Gov's font is Avenir, a san serif typeface. Avenir is the French word for "future," which aligns with Grants.Gov's position in the sphere of government websites as a hub for experimentation, innovative thinking, infrastructure building, and systemic change.</p>
        <p>Avenir's simplicity allows users to focus solely on the important information and avoid distractions by using only one font with various weights, which is crucial for grantmakers who need to closely follow application instructions for a successful grant proposal submission.</p>
        <p>Iconography plays a factor in the way Grants.Gov users interact with the website. The majority of the icons are shades of purple that blend into with the rest of the website aesthetic. The exceptions to this design choice are the Search and Check icons. In addition to purple, Search can also be pink to emphasize the Call to Action for grantmakers to seek funding opportunities. The Check icon is green to indicate "positive" feedback (i.e. submit, completion, etc.).</p></p>

<h2>Usability Tests</h2>

<div class="conclusion">
<h2>Reflection and Next Steps</h2>
<h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>Overall, we had a lot of fun redesigning Grants.Gov. In addition to the UI skills we improved on in this unit, our skill sets complemented each other very well. One of us comes from a graphic design background while the other has experience with grants research and writing, providing us a massive advantage for this case study.</p>
<p>While we were concerned that class moved remotely about a week into this case study, we quickly embraced the transition thanks to the convenience of video conferencing apps like Google Hangouts and Zoom as well as digital collaboration tools such as Miro, Invision, and Adobe XD. These tools really pushed us to be in constant communication with each other.</p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<ul>
    <li><b>Desktop and Mobile</b> / Build more pages. We would like to create the rest of the pages in the "Grants 101" sub-navigation of "About Grants" and demonstrate how the "Search Grants" function would look like. Additionally, experiment with more micro-interactions, especially ones that users often experience on other websites.</li>
    <li><b>Desktop-Specific</b> / Experiment with more button states besides "Normal" and "Hover," such as "Pressed and "Disabled."</li>
    <li><b>Mobile-Specific</b> / Experiment with different gestures besides scrolling up and down.</li>
</ul>
